    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 cup Italian-style breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 (24-ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup grated mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
        <li>In a shallow dish, mix together the breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>In another shallow dish, beat the eggs. Place the flour in a third shallow dish.</li>
        <li>Coat each chicken breast in the flour, shaking off any excess. Dip the chicken into the beaten eggs, then coat it with the breadcrumb mixture, pressing to help it adhere.</li>
        <li>Place the coated chicken breasts on a baking sheet. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the breading is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the marinara sauce in a saucepan over medium heat. When the chicken is cooked, top each breast with a spoonful of the sauce and a sprinkle of mozzarella cheese. Return the chicken to the oven and bake for an additional 5-10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Garnish the chicken with fresh basil and serve with pasta or your choice of side dish. Enjoy!</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
