    <h2>Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe</h2>
    <p>These classic chocolate chip cookies are soft, chewy, and loaded with chocolate chips. They're the perfect sweet treat for any occasion.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined.</li>
        <li>Fold in the chocolate chips. Drop the dough by rounded tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches of space between the cookies.</li>
        <li>Bake the cookies for 8-10 minutes, or until they are lightly golden around the edges. Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy!</li>
