      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until the meat is browned and the onion is tender. Drain off any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in the marinara sauce and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup of the mozzarella cheese, the Parmesan cheese, and the egg.</li>
        <li>Spread a small amount of the meat sauce in the bottom of the baking dish. Arrange 4 of the lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the cheese mixture over the noodles. Top with another layer of noodles, the remaining meat sauce, and the remaining cheese mixture.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese over the top. Bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the lasagna is hot and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
